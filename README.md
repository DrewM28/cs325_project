Using phi-3 mini to pass along three prompts and get the responses from the sLLM and put them into a new txt file

Using an inference API from huggingface I called phi-3 and read the prompts from a txt file then got the responses from phi-3 and put them into a different txt file.

There is a Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct folder that I don't know if it is needed or not.
