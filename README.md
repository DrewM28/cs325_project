Using phi-3 mini to pass along three prompts and get the responses from the sLLM and put them into a new txt file

First step I imported the hugging face inference client to call Phi-3. The second step was reading in the prompts from my prompts.txt file. I used a with open on my prompts.txt file and r to just read the file. I then use a prompts variable to store the results I get from using file.readlines() which reads everything. The third step is to call Phi-3. I did this using hugging face and a personalized token which I got from my log in and got the code using an inference API. It then stores the responses into a list. I set it only have max tokens of 100. Response_content then uses message to retrieve the message, choices[0] to take the first choice of the response, delta is used to increment the response, and get("content", "") gets the values associated with content and if there is not anything it returns an empty string. Next the if statement appends response_content to the responses list. My final step is to open my new response file and use a w to write to the file. i use a ''.join(responses) because my to turn the responses from the list into a string to write them to the file.
